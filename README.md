### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical specialist (presales architect) specializing in Azure App Innovation solutions. I like to dabble with Python and PowerShell, building [toys](https://github.com/tjsullivan1/invoice-generator) and [tools](https://github.com/tjsullivan1/tjs-scripts) for myself. 


- ðŸ”­ Outside of helping enterprises build their cloud solutions, Iâ€™m currently working on building a site and tools for [my fraternity alumni chapter](https://www.mnsigs.com), you can see the code for this in my repos. I might also get around to doing this for a personal site as well as my rental properties.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Python
  - Kubernetes
  - Azure AI technologies
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Azure, Personal Finance, Real Estate
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: shoot me an email OR connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjsullivan1/) -- be sure to mention you found me on GitHub.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
